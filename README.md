# EmployeeDaysOff
A web application that allows employees to view and create leave requests. Through this application, administrators can record and edit employee data, as well as add the number of available leave days for the current year. Employees can view their own leave status, add new leave requests by selecting a period in the calendar, and see the leave status of other employees.
I worked on the generic notification toast component and service, as well as the "My Days Off" screen, where I integrated  and parametrized Angular FullCalendar. This setup allows users to manage and interact with leave requests efficiently within the calendar view and the generic datePicker.
